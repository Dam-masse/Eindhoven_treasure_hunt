#Welcome to the Einhoven Tresure hunt 

In this repo you will find a series of files for a treasure hunt around the city of light. 
This is all inspired by the integrated photonics echosystem :) 

For following along you will find a replace.py file that you can use reveal the map. 
At each location you will need to look for a QR code that will give you the passphrase for decripting the next part of the map. 
The first QR code can be found around the Ginscal cocktail bar :) or what remains of it. 
Have fun !!
